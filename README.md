# Three principles of responsive design
    1. Fluid Grids and Layouts:
        Uses % rather than px for all layout-related lengths
    2. Flexible/ responsive images:
        Ensure that images adapt nicely to the current view port
    3. Media queries:
        To change styles on certain viewport widths(breakpoints), 
        allowing to create different version of website for different widths.
